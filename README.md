# cryptovaluer

This project aims at understanding trading signals from cryptocurrencies

We extract the historical data from CoinMarketCap and load into a local PostgresDB in order to further analyze the data.

The data is subject to a first pass of EDA to create some technical signals.

The data is used to create a webApp through Streamlit and Heroku
